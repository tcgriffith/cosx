\usage{
cosay(what = "Hello world!", by = "random", type = "message", what_color = NULL, 
    by_color = NULL, length = 18, fortune = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{what}{(character) What do you want to say? See details.}

\item{by}{(character) Type of thing, one of cow, chicken, poop, cat, facecat,
bigcat, longcat, shortcat, behindcat, longtailcat, anxiouscat, grumpycat,
smallcat, ant, pumpkin, ghost, spider, rabbit, pig, snowman, frog, hypnotoad,
signbunny, stretchycat, fish, trilobite, shark, buffalo, clippy, mushroom,
monkey, egret, or rms for Richard Stallman.
Alternatively, use "random" to have your message spoken by a random
character.
We use \code{\link{match.arg}} internally, so you can use unique parts of
words that don't conflict with others, like "g" for "ghost" because there's
no other animal that starts with "g".}

\item{type}{(character) One of message (default), warning, or string
(returns string). If multiple colors are supplied to \code{what_color} or
\code{by_color}, type cannot be warning. (This is a limitation of the \href{https://github.com/aedobbyn/multicolor}{multicolor} packcage :/.)}

\item{what_color}{(character or crayon function) One or more
\href{https://github.com/r-lib/crayon#256-colors}{\code{crayon}}-suported text color(s)
or \href{https://github.com/r-lib/crayon#styles}{\code{crayon style function}} to color
 \code{what}. You might try \code{colors()} or \code{?rgb} for ideas.
Use "rainbow" for c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple").}

\item{by_color}{(character or crayon function) One or more
\href{https://github.com/r-lib/crayon#256-colors}{\code{crayon}}-suported text color(s)
or \href{https://github.com/r-lib/crayon#styles}{\code{crayon style function}} to color
 \code{who}.
 Use "rainbow" for c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple").}

\item{length}{(integer) Length of longcat. Ignored if other animals used.}

\item{fortune}{An integer specifying the row number of cosxs.data.
Alternatively which can be a character and grep is used to try to find a
suitable row.}

\item{...}{Further args passed on to \code{\link[fortunes]{fortune}}}
}
\description{
Sling messages and warnings with flair
}
\details{
You can put in any phrase you like, OR you can type in one of a few
special phrases that do particular things. They are:

\itemize{
 \item catfact A random cat fact from https://catfact.ninja
 \item fortune A random quote from an R coder, from fortunes library
 \item time Print the current time
 \item rms Prints a random 'fact' about Richard Stallman from the
 \code{\link[rmsfact]{rmsfact}}
 package. Best paired with \code{by = "rms"}.
}

Note that if you choose \code{by='hypnotoad'} the quote is forced to be,
as you could imagine, 'All Glory to the HYPNO TOAD!'. For reference see

Signbunny: It's not for sure known who invented signbunny, but this article
http://www.vox.com/2014/9/18/6331753/sign-bunny-meme-explained thinks
they found the first use in this tweet:
https://twitter.com/wei_bluebear/status/329101645780770817

Trilobite: from http://www.retrojunkie.com/asciiart/animals/dinos.htm (site
down though)

Note to Windows users: there are some animals (shortcat, longcat, fish,
signbunny, stretchycat, anxiouscat, longtailcat, grumpycat, mushroom) that
are not available because they use non-ASCII characters that don't display
properly in R on Windows.
