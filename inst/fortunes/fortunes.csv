"I'm really curious to know why the ""two types"" of sum of squares are called ""Type I"" and ""Type III""! This is a very common misconception, particularly among SAS users who have been fed this nonsense quite often for all their professional lives. Fortunately the reality is much simpler. There is, by any sensible reckoning, only ONE type of sum of squares, and it always represents an improvement sum of squares of the outer (or alternative) model over the inner (or null hypothesis) model. What the SAS highly dubious classification of sums of squares does is to encourage users to concentrate on the null hypothesis model and to forget about the alternative. This is always a very bad idea and not surprisingly it can lead to nonsensical tests, as in the test it provides for main effects ""even in the presence of interactions"", something which beggars definition, let alone belief.";Bill Venables;NA;R-help;November 2000

A sufficiently trained statistician can read the vagaries of a Q-Q plot like a shaman can read a chicken's entrails, with a similar recourse to scientific principles. Interpreting Q-Q plots is more a visceral than an intellectual exercise. The uninitiated are often mystified by the process. Experience is the key here.;Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Murdoch University;NA;StatsNotes;NA

"We are teaching stuff like mathematics, statistics, statistical programming and so on, but we cannot teach each possible software product - we also don't teach how to analyze each possible dataset that might find its way to the statistician's desk, we just use the iris data and Anscombe's quartet. ;-)";Uwe Ligges;in a thread about whether universities have to teach students how to use commercial software;R-help;April 2005
